dmenu - dynamic menu
====================

dmenu is an efficient dynamic menu for X.

This is my personal fork of it with additional scripts, patches, and configuration.


## Requirements
------------
In order to build dmenu you need the Xlib header files.


## Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your setup (my fork is installed to the /usr namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dmenu (if necessary as root):

    make clean install


## Running dmenu
-------------
See the man page for details.
